Today, in this blog post, I want to talk about a very useful regression method: Ordinary Least Squares. It is frequently used in economics, statistics, and data science. It is simple to use, but it is also the foundation of some of the more advanced regression methods.

So you may ask: what is ordinary least squares? What is a regression? And why am I learning this? What am I gonna use it for? Just bear with me, and I will provide examples of why regressions are very useful in todayâ€™s world. Also, because this blog is just an elementary introduction for ordinary least squares, so I will not dive into the difficult math equations to prove its assumptions and merits. Nor will I go over specific codes to calculate it. It is beyond the scope of this blog.
