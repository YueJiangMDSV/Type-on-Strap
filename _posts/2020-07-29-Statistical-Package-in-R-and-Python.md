In this blog post, I will briefly introduce a statistical package I developed along with three teammates when I was studying in the Master of Data Science (MDS) program at UBC. This package provides functions to generate a virtual population, draw samples, plot the sample histogram, and the sampling histogram. It aims to help people understand the basic concepts of population, sample, and sampling distributions in statistical inference. 
    
This package is available both in R and Python. It is called `samplingsimulatorr` in R and `samplingsimulatorpy` in Python. You can find the Github repositories in [`samplingsimulatorr`](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/samplingsimulatorr) and [`samplingsimulatorpy`](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/samplingsimulatorpy).

When I was learning statistical inference at first, I often got confused by the sampling concepts like population distribution, sample distribution, and sampling distribution. That is why I want to create this package to offer people handy tools to generate those distributions, help people distinguish the concepts, and smooth the learning curve.
