In this project, me and 3 other team members from the MDS program created a R package and a Python package to assist learning and teaching statistical inference. This package offers handy functions to generate virtual samples, draw samples of different sizes, create sample histograms, and create sampling histograms.

Here is the histogram of sample distribution:

{% include aligner.html images="post_img/sample_hist.png" %}


![]({{ "/assets/img/post_img/sample_hist.png" | relative_url}})
