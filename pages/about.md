My name is Alex. I completed the Master of Data Science ([MDS](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/)) program at UBC on June 30, 2020. I am now actively looking for data scientist/data analyst opportunities.

Throughout the program, I had the privilege to work with many wonderful people and sharpen my skills in machine learning and data science. I acquired both supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques, such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, K-means, DBSCAN, and PCA. I also had the chance to work on Keras and TesorFlow to build CNN for image classification and LSTM for text classification and Natural Language processing. 

Meanwhile, I also worked on several course projects such as building Python and R packages, creating interactive dashboard, and building machine learning models to solve real world problems. 

In my capstone project, which is the project we need to accomplish to complete the program, my team and I conducted data analysis on 10-year crash data, demographic data, and connected vehicle data to discover reasons behind car accidents and improvements in city planning. I built a machine learning model to identify dangerous intersections and key factors contributing to the dangerous level of intersections in the city. A dashboard was also created to visualize the data and model predictions. 

Prior to MDS, I was an operational analyst at an insurance company in China. I built an end-to-end data pipeline from data gathering, data wrangling, data visualization to report generation to track KPI and discover opportunities to improve operational efficiency. 

Prior to that, I was an investment associate at a private equity firm in the Silicon Valley. I conducted due diligence investigations for a number of projects and was the project lead for 3 projects, from end-to-end. I also built financial pro forma models to assess the financial feasibility and forecast the operational performance of projects. 

I also have a bachelor’s degree in English Literature, a master’s degree in International Studies, and another master’s degree in Economics. 
I am a data-driven, detail-oriented, and passionate person, as well as a quick learner. I love working with data and transforming data into insightful recommendations to help people make better informed decisions. I have worked and studied in multiple areas/industries, and I am always passionate for new challenges. 

I am ready to start the next stage of my life. I am looking forward to new opportunities, and I will hit the ground running on the new position. 

Send me a message if you are working on a data science project and want a helping hand. Or if you are recruiting for a company that needs a data scientist/data analyst to help them extract insights and generate value from lots of data. You can contact me at (+1) 778-927-5989 or yue_jiang2019@outlook.com.
